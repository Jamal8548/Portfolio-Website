# Project : Portfolio Website
## by Jamal Ashraf


It is to be an online portfolio site  to showcase my projects. It is a static & responsive website built using [HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-html5-20100624/) and css framework - [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

You can download or clone the project to explore it by yourself. Open up the *index.html*, from the root directory, to view it in the browser or play around by making changes :)

<small>*(P.S:  The website is made responsive to the maximum extent using bootstrap-4 grid layout and css media queries. It is tested on IE9, Edge, Chrome and Firefox browsers. Responsiveness of the layout, images and text is tested using the developer tools of Chrome and Firefox browsers. Tested for: Nexus 5, IPad & desktop.
Both the index.html and styles.css files are validated online. Screenshot of the results are available in the root folder )*</small>
